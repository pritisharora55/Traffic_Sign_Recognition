# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

Traffic sign recognition is the process of identifying and classifying traffic signs in real-time using computer vision techniques. It is a crucial task in the field of intelligent transportation systems, as it enables vehicles to understand and respond to the visual cues present in the environment. This can assist in navigation, decision-making, and safety for both human-driven and autonomous vehicles.
Traffic signs serve as important visual cues for drivers, providing information about the rules and regulations of the road, as well as potential hazards and directions. Some common types of traffic signs include stop signs, speed limit signs, and turn restriction signs. Accurate and timely recognition of these signs is essential for safe and efficient navigation.
In this project, we propose the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques for traffic sign recognition. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that are well-suited for image recognition tasks, including traffic sign recognition. CNNs are able to learn hierarchical representations of spatial features in an input image, allowing them to make accurate predictions. Transfer learning is a technique that can be used to accelerate the training of a CNN for a specific task, by leveraging the knowledge learned by a pre-trained model on a large dataset.
